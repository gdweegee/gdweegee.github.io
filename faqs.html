<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<b>Can you accomodate larger groups?</b> Yes, I am happy to discuss taking larger groups.<br><br>

<b>Does your fee include any entry to paid attractions?</b> No, my tours do not include entry into any paid attractions; these include Edinburgh Castle and Holyrood Palace.<br><br>

<b>Can you accomodate people with disabilities?</b> If you do have mobility issues then please mention this in your booking email, I am much more interested in what you can do as opposed to what you cannot and will tailor any tour accordingly.<br><br>

<b>Is it good for kids?</b> I am very happy doing tours for families and will tailor accordingly based on the ages of all those joining us. This might involve visiting the museum, spending more time being inspired by Harry Potter and choosing a child-friendly place to eat. <br><br>
