### I love what I do

It is great to meet people that wish to learn about Edinburgh and hear and see about our mesmerising history and undeniable charm. Born in Glasgow, I have traveled all across Scotland and am now a resident in Edinburgh where I can share my experiences.

I know my history, I like to bring it to life with stories of Scottish legends, beautiful buildings, famous and infamous characters – all done with a smile.

I walk a lot around Edinburgh, I travel all across Scotland. I recommend the bars and restaurants that I frequent myself, the sites I visit – both obvious and the hidden gems, I tell the tales that make me laugh or leave me thinking about and appreciating our past.




### But don't take my word for it...

I became a tour guide as it allows me to bring my passions in life into my job. I am a member of Historic Scotland and love touring museums, castles and historic sites. I explore both Edinburgh and all of Scotland looking at the picturesque views and stunning vistas. I can frequently be found in a bar or restaurant, enjoying Scottish food and drink, also embracing other cultures.

One of my favourite times of the year is the month of August when during The Edinburgh Festival I can see theatre, comedy, circus and listen to live music. I love sport and don’t expect me to be available if Scotland are playing rugby or if I am playing golf.


I read avidly, The Writers Museum with Robert Burns, Walter Scott and Robert Louis Stephenson is a great free place to visit in the city. I am no expert in Harry Potter – but I know a bit more than just finding Tom Riddell’s grave and am no expert in Outlander (but have tour guide friends who are) but know the filming sites.

I used to run a whisky shop on the Royal Mile and know the best bars to visit for a dram, and can make recommendations on Scottish whisky and gin with matching local delicacies.

Feel free to ask me for any recommendations of things to do, places to eat and drink, things to see, places to shop or anything that will enhance a visit to Edinburgh or Scotland. Happy to be helpful and friendly.
