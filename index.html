    I offer a range of walking tours in Edinburgh.
    My tours are tailored to you. I'll meet you at your hotel accomodation, all you have to do is choose a time and length of tour that fits in with your Edinburgh visit.

  <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Edinburgh Highlights Walking Tour</h3>
  
  <p>
    Starting near Edinburgh Castle I'll take you on a wander around The Old Town and down The Royal Mile, or High Street
    as the locals call it. You will hear about the history of the castle, experience the main street and the hidden 
    ‚ÄúWynds‚Äù, learn about famous figures from the past and laugh at the stories and legends associated with the city.
    We will look at the Old and New Towns, walk through the Grassmarket and Greyfriars Kirkyard, marvel 
    at St Giles Cathedral and the city‚Äôs architecture, pass sites of importance and hear tales of culture. 
    Tailored to you ‚Äì we can stop for a local snack or drink and will end near Holyrood Palace after 3 hours.

  <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Something to Note </h3>
  <p>
    The first thing to note is that Edinburgh is very much a walking city, it is small and compact and 
    best experienced on foot. While walking around you will learn about why Scotland is famous for many things;
    our history, our culture, our friendly people and our stunning scenery ‚Äì but let‚Äôs not muck about, it rains.
    A lot. Please dress accordingly and don‚Äôt fear, a diversion into one of our indoor attractions is always 
    an option.
